# Analyzing Healthcare data in PBI

This repository contains a Power BI case study analyzing New York State hospital discharge data, focusing on elective hip replacement surgical inpatient stays. The analysis explores key metrics like Length of Stay (LOS), costs, and patient outcomes across different hospitals and regions.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The project uses Power BI to visualize and analyze healthcare data from New York State hospitals, with a focus on:
- Length of Stay (LOS) comparisons across hospitals
- Cost analysis for discharges
- Hospital performance profiles
- Key influencers on healthcare metrics

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources

The analysis uses hospital discharge data containing:
- Facility information (name, location, certification)
- Patient demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity)
- Clinical data (diagnoses, procedures, severity of illness)
- Financial data (total charges, total costs)
- Outcome metrics (length of stay, patient disposition)

## ðŸ“Š Key Visualizations

1. **LOS Comparison Dashboard**
   - Average LOS Days vs Total Discharges by hospital
   - Top/Bottom hospitals by average LOS
   - Key influencers on LOS (e.g., patient disposition, risk of mortality)

2. **Cost Comparison Dashboard**
   - Average Cost per Discharge by hospital
   - Regional cost variations
   - Relationship between LOS and costs

3. **Hospital Profile Dashboard**
   - Individual hospital performance metrics
   - Discharge breakdowns by:
     - Severity of illness
     - Diagnosis categories
     - Patient disposition

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings

- Average LOS for elective hip replacements: 2.65 days
- Total hospitals analyzed: 151
- Total discharges in dataset: 26,000
- Key factors increasing LOS:
  - Discharge to skilled nursing homes (+1.29 days)
  - NYC health service area (+1.68 days)
  - Major/Extreme risk of mortality (+2.48/+6.09 days)
